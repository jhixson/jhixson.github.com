		<h2><a href="#" rel="bookmark">about the site</a></h2>
		<p>nerdcore was created in 2001 as an outlet for random 
		ramblings and has served that purpose for the past 10 years. 
		The content featured here is diverse, but mostly in the realm 
		of web technology/nerdy/music related topics.</p>
		<p>The author is Jesse Hixson, a web developer from western 
		Pennsylvania. He likes cats, mashups and TV cooking shows.</p>
		<p>This blog was originally powered by static HTML files and later 
		by blogging engines, usually WordPress. It is the 
		author's opionion that WordPress has become a bit convoluted in
		recent versions and is no longer really necessary.</p>
		<p>For fun and extra nerd-cred we're back to static HTML, this 
		time served up by Jekyll on GitHub.</p>
