Together with [Benjamin Krause](http://blog.omdb-beta.org) I wrote an article on the [Ferret](http://ferret.davebalmain.com/trac/) and [acts\_as\_ferret](http://projects.jkraemer.net/acts_as_ferret/) for the German IT magazine [iX](http://www.ix.de/) which was published today. The article is part of a Ruby on Rails special which also includes articles on the current state of Rails and [deployment with Capistrano](http://www.heise.de/ix/artikel/2007/11/058), both written by [Ralf Wirdemann and Thomas Baustert](http://www.b-simple.de/). Go grab it while it's hot (and available).

In other news, everyone's favorite freelancing site [FreelanceSwitch](http://freelanceswitch.com) recently started a podcast called ["Freelance Radio"](http://freelanceswitch.com/podcasts). I highly recommend checking it out.
